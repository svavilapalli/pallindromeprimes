# pallindromeprimes

Problem Statement:

Create a Python program that helps you find special numbers! You'll input two positive numbers, m and n (where m is smaller than n), and the program should tell you how many special numbers are between them (inclusively). The program should not only count these special numbers but also show them to you.
If there are less than 6 special numbers, it should display all of them. Otherwise, it should show you the first three smallest special numbers and the last three biggest special numbers.
Special numbers are those that are both prime (only divisible by 1 and themselves) and palindromic (read the same backwards as forward).
The program must not use a hard-coded list of values (you can utmost have 5 values hard-coded) or an external data file to assist the computation. The program is encouraged to finish within 1 hour (run-time) for any test case. Each solution should be your own work, and it's allowed to use Python's built-in libraries. Try to keep your program concise, not exceeding 100 lines.
Examples:
Input (m n) Output (Total: Special Numbers) Comments
1 3
2: 2, 3
List of special numbers = 2,3
Total number of special numbers = 2
1 20
5: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
List of special numbers = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
Total number of special numbers = 5
2 200
10: 2, 3, 5, 151, 181, 191
Total number of special numbers = 2, 3, 5, 151, 181, 191
Total number of special numbers = 10
