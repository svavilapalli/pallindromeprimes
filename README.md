# palindromeprimes

Problem Statement:

Create a Python program that helps you find prime numbers which are palindromes! You'll input two positive numbers, m and n (where m is smaller than n), and the program should tell you how many such numbers are between them (inclusively). The program should give the count and numbers.
The program must finish within 1 hour (run-time) for any test case, with n as high as 1000000000000. Try to keep your program concise, not exceeding 100 lines.
Examples:
Input (m n) Output (Total: Special Numbers) Comments
1 3
2: 2, 3
List of special numbers = 2,3
Total number of special numbers = 2
1 20
5: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
List of special numbers = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
Total number of special numbers = 5
2 200
10: 2, 3, 5, 151, 181, 191
Total number of special numbers = 2, 3, 5, 151, 181, 191
Total number of special numbers = 10
